# conversion_project_classification

This project is to predict the conversion rate for a company. 

I compared two widely used algorithm using the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F score.

Though random forest has many advantages such as not sensitive to outliers, takes little time to optimize because the default parameters are often close to be the optimized ones already. Logistic regression could provide some directly insights for the team to improve the program. 

The initial result shows the logistic regression has a slightly higher performance than random forest. 

In addition, I also applied deep learning, using tensorflow keras to build the model. The model performance is similar as the logistic regression model with an accuracy score of 0.9855.
